# Rossmos-Formula
Can math catch serial killers? Well, for Kim Rossmo it's possible!

## Introduction

This program is based in Rossmo's formula, to predict where a serial criminal
lives based on the location of the crimes. In the program, the green cells indicate body drop 
sites and the blue cell indicate his residence.

## How it works?

Using Rossmo's formula, the probability *P* for a given cell at 
row *i* and column *j* to be the killers residence is given by...

where

and is indicated by the color of each cell. The brighter the color
the higher the probability.
You can add or remove crimes, set killer residence and change 
the values of variables however you want.
